# RFM Customer Segmentation & Cohort Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on RFM analysis and cohort analysis to gain valuable insights into customer behavior. RFM analysis is a powerful technique in marketing and customer relationship management, helping to categorize customers based on their recency of purchase, frequency of purchase, and monetary value. Cohort analysis, on the other hand, provides a deeper understanding of user behavior over time.
